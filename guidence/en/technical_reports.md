# Technical Reports (Fusion & Nuclear)

Scope: Project deliverables, design notes, safety/QA reports, and performance assessments.

Structure
- Cover page: title, authors, organization, date, version
- Executive Summary (1–2 pages)
- Table of Contents, List of Figures/Tables, Acronyms
- 1. Introduction (scope, context, standards/references)
- 2. Requirements and Constraints
- 3. Methods (models, codes, experiments, QA/QC)
- 4. Results (performance, verification/validation)
- 5. Discussion (limitations, risks)
- 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
- 7. References
- Appendices (data tables, calculation details, drawings, procedures)

Standards alignment
- Numbering: ISO 2145
- Units: SI Brochure; ISO/IEC 80000; see `../common/units_nuclear.md`
- References: ISO 690 (EN) or GB/T 7714 (ZH)

QA/QC and traceability
- Record code versions, input decks, nuclear data libraries (e.g., ENDF/B, JEFF), mesh/solver settings.
- Document V&V steps; include uncertainty quantification if applicable.

Safety & regulatory context (as applicable)
- Identify applicable codes/standards (e.g., pressure vessels, radiation protection).
- Maintain configuration control; include revision history and change logs.

Figures, tables, and attachments
- Use consistent captioning and numbering; all attachments referenced in body.

Checklist
- [ ] Executive summary reflects main findings and recommendations
