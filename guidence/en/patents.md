- Abstract

Claims drafting principles
- One independent claim per category (apparatus, method, composition) where appropriate; dependent claims add limitations.
- Each claim is a single sentence; ensure antecedent basis ("the module" after "a module").
- Avoid relative/subjective terms without definitions; enablement and clarity are critical.
- Use reference numerals in the description (not in claims unless allowed), consistent across drawings.

Terminology and units
- Use SI as primary; define specialized nuclear terms; avoid trademarks and commercial names.
- Avoid unnecessary limitations in claims (e.g., specific numeric ranges) unless essential.

Enablement and best mode
- Provide enough detail to implement across the claimed scope; include variants and ranges.
- Include drawings/flowcharts where beneficial; ensure figure legends map to description.

Disclosure control
- Check export control and security restrictions; coordinate publication timing if dual‑use concerns.

Checklist
- [ ] Clear problem statement and advantages over prior art
- [ ] Claims cover core inventive concepts; dependent claims provide fallback
- [ ] Embodiments enable implementation; drawings consistent
- [ ] Terminology consistent; units SI; nuclear notation correct
- [ ] Prior art cited properly per office requirements
